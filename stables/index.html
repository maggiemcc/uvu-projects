    <p>Maggie's Stables is a family run facility which is located in Utah. Wether you're looking to go on a scenic horseback ride or wanting to take lessons, we offer both at affordable prices.</p>
    
    <p>You can join us each day for <a href="rides.html#rides">horseback rides</a> on beautiful Utah trails. Each day we offer three times to go on a beautiful horseback ride on two different trails. Two of the times we offer are <a href="rides.html#one">one hour rides</a> and the third is <a href="rides.html#two">two hours</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Not only do we do rides, but we also offer lessons for all levels. All riders from beginners to experienced are welcome to come and learn at our facility.</p>
    
    <p>Here is what Jane Doe had to say about their experience at our stables</p>
    
    <!-- Permission granted fall 2019 via email -->
    <blockquote>"I had a wonderful experience at Maggie's Stables. I had the opportunity to come to Utah to visit family and we signed up for a one hour ride with them. The staff members were kind and helpful to each of us, especially the kids. Also, the ride itself was beautiful. I recommend visiting Maggie's Stables if your ever in Utah."</blockquote>
    
     <p>It would be our greatest pleasure to take you on scenic rides through Utah or help you learn riding.</p>
